# TransferGAN

This repo holds a Pytorch adaptation of [Transferring GANs: generating images from limited data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01677) (EECV 2018), still in progress. I may try some additional experiments after replicating the original results...

## Dependencies
- Python 3

- Torch 1.7.1

- Numpy 1.19.4

- Torchvision 0.8.2

- Imageio 2.9.0

## Sources and inspiration
Much of this codebase is indebted to implementation ideas from Emilien Dupont's 
Pytorch [implementation](https://github.com/EmilienDupont/wgan-gp) of WGAN-GP 
and Naoto Inoue's Pytorch [implementation](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN) of AdaIN.
